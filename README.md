## Description
This application is not deployed and works via the terminal.

It reports key data based on information located in an 2d array data structure.

The following list is the information this application intends to extract:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period
- The average of the changes in profit/losses over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## Installation
The application comes with a data set within a array data structure, however if this array is to be updated with a new set of data, then the user should conduct the instructions below:
- Add 'export' at the beginning of the variable that includes the array in question. This file needs to be located within this same directory
- Update the first 2 lines in "main.js" by changing the import argument to the variable of the array in question and by correcting the file path if needed
- Within "main.js" change the assignment of 'inputData' to the variable of the array in question


## Usage
The application can only be used with a data set organised within a 2d array data structure with the first inner element including a date and the second inner element including an integer.
